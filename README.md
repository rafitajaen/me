# Hey, I’m Rafael 👋  
*Solopreneur from Andalucía, Spain — building and learning in public.*  

I share the projects I’m working on, ideas I’m testing, and experiments that keep me learning.  
Some become real products, others are just stepping stones — but every single one shapes the journey.  
Welcome to my little corner of the internet 👇
